	 * To use this class, first create a Map instance:
	 *
	 * || Map enemyMap = new Map(10,10);
	 *
	 * then create a computerShot instance:
	 *
	 * || ComputerShot computerShot = new ComputerShot ();
	 *
	 * then create a 'checkered' map:
	 *
	 * || Map checkeredMap;
	 * || checkeredMap = computerShot.shotCheckerSteps(enemyMap);
	 *
	 * then generate new shot coordinates by passing a 'checkered' map and a lastShot coordinats to the computerShot instance:
	 *
	 * || computerShot.checkForPreviousHits(checkeredMap, lastShot);
	 */

	 * 9 - useless cell, was thrown out initially after generating a 'checkers' map, will never choose it with random chooser, but will shoot it 
	 * 10 - regular cell, have never shoot it
	 * 1 - regular cell, have shot it and missed
	 * 2 - regular cell, have shot it and hit the target
	 * 3 - regular cell, have shot it, hit the target and hit the whole ship
